Until this point in history, electrum, a naturally occurring alloy of gold and silver, was used for currency. Croesus' genius came in the creation of “a complex interrelated, bimetallic monetary system” using the first ever pure gold and pure silver coins. This system established a silver to gold ratio of 13:1 meaning that thirteen Silver Staters was worth one Gold Stater. The large Staters were complimented by fractional denominations as small as a 1/24th Stater - an expansive, but popular project for set-builders."
